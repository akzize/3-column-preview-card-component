## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Actualy i learn a lot from doing this project:
  -I got more information about resposive web : when and how to use max/min width , when to use absolute or relative units
  
  That's for this project 
  
  hope we will learn more by doing other projects
  the more **practice** you do the more **information** you got
  


### Useful resources

- [media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me in resposive design, i love the way they use grid view to change the components position according to the device width. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
